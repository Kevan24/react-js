export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a student, I study at a school called SMK MEDIKACOM Bandung city, at this school I major in RPL. I learned a lot of coding in this RPL and I am already a little good at creating websites. I can't believe it's been two years since I've been here and I've learned a lot about the web. When creating a website, there are many things that must be used, for example HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, MySQL, and others. I'm also a little good at making websites about selling whatever it is, because in my journey so far I have easily mastered coding. I hope that in the future I can gain a lot of knowledge about coding.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `At this school I also got a lot of friends who understand what coding is. I'm happy to have friends who understand coding so when I'm learning I can easily understand several things because of the help from my friends and I've learned coding so far, I don't know. I will be able to fully understand it or not, but the most important thing is that I can do it, that alone is more than enough. When I first entered the RPL class, I was confused about coding, I didn't understand it, but day by day I was able to understand it and understood it, even though sometimes I still felt confused about the coding I made because it failed or something was missing, but it was there. My teacher and friends have all resolved it, but I also don't want to continue to depend on my friends or teachers. I want to try on my own so that later I can master coding. Soon I will enter the world of work so I have to study harder and be more focused in the future.`;
